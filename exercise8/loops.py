# Python has two primitive loop commands:
# while loops and for loops 
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:


print('welecome to loops')

# for loops for each item in a group of items 
# do something to that item

# for loops with the range function 
# for each time in a number of times
# do something 

# while loop
