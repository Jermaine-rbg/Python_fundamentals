# Python has two primitive loop commands:
# while loops and for loops 
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:


# print('welecome to loops')

laundry_basket = ['jeans', 'sweater', 'tank top', 'dress shirt']
#      garment =


# for each garment in our laundry basket 
#    fold the garment
#    put away the garment
# clean clothes

for garment in laundry_basket:
    print(f'fold the garment {garment}')
    print(f'put away the garment {garment}' )
    print()

print('clean clothes')




# for loops for each item in a group of items 
# do something to that item

# for loops with the range function 
# for each time in a number of times
# do something 

# while loop
